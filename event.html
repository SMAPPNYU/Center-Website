        (19 W. 4th Street).
        <br>
        <br>
        Abstract:
        <br>
        <br>
        We find that social group membership, operationalized as a psychological 
        affinity toward others who are "like you", causes individuals to mirror 
        the political behaviors and choices of similar others. We conduct two 
        experiments where we demonstrate the power of these impersonal social 
        group influences through social group cues. In these experiments, 
        providing the subjects with social group cues successfully alters both 
        behavior and opinion. In the field experiment, we demonstrate voters 
        change their behavior in accord with a message telling them about levels 
        of turnout among similar others. In the survey experiment, we demonstrate 
        respondents change their position on political issues based upon what 
        they are told about the positions of similar others. We find no evidence 
        that these effects are attributable to alternative mechanisms, such as 
        need for information, confirming the effects are likely caused by the 
        desire to adopt the appropriate political social norm.
        <br>
        <br>
        We hope very much that you will be able to join us!

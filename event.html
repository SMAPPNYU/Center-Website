        The NYU Center for Social and Political Behavior hosted a colloquium talk 
		by Professor <a href="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~redlawsk"> David Redlawsk </a> of 
		Rutgers University on Friday, May 10, 2013.
        <br><br>
        David Redlawsk is Editor of <a	
		href="http://us.macmillan.com/feelingpolitics/DavidRedlawsk"> 
		"Feeling Politics: Emotion in Political Information Processing"</a>
        and Co-author of <a 
		href="http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511222993&ss=cop"> 
		"How Voters Decide: Information Processing in Election Campaigns"</a>. Professor 
		Redlawsk's talk (with Doug Pierce) was entitled "Studying Information Processing with 
		Dynamic Process Tracing: A First Look at Social Cues." 
        <br><br>
        Abstract:
        <br>
    	Understanding how voters form preferences for candidates requires
        knowledge of information search strategies, which may be conditioned on
        factors such as the competitiveness of the election, the complexity of
        the information environment, individual dispositional factors, and
        emotional responses to candidates and issues. Existing research along
        these lines tends to focus on the individual and fails to treat information
        search as at least in part a social activity. In this talk I will
        introduce an experimental tool called the Dynamic Process Tracing
        Environment (DPTE) which has been successfully used to observe
        information search processes in complex information environments. In
        particular I will focus on a new extension to DPTE which allows the
        researcher to create a "social" environment, where information
        may be tagged with social cues either in a controlled experimental
        environment or by subjects themselves, or some combination. New data on
        effects of social cues on information search in a campaign environment
        will be presented and discussed, as we begin our initial studies using
        social experiments in DPTE.

        The NYU Center for Social and Political Behavior has held its Inaugural Event on Friday, 
		April 26, 2013.
        <br><br>
        Dr. Betsy Sinclair (University of Chicago), author of 
        <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/The-Social-Citizen-Networks-Political/dp/0226922820">
		"The Social Citizen: Peer Networks and Political Behavior." </a>
        Her talk was entitled "Voters Like You: Social Group Cues in Behavior and Opinion."
        <br><br>
        Abstract:
        <br>
        We find that social group membership, operationalized as a psychological 
        affinity toward others who are "like you", causes individuals to mirror 
        the political behaviors and choices of similar others. We conduct two 
        experiments where we demonstrate the power of these impersonal social 
        group influences through social group cues. In these experiments, 
        providing the subjects with social group cues successfully alters both 
        behavior and opinion. In the field experiment, we demonstrate voters 
        change their behavior in accord with a message telling them about levels 
        of turnout among similar others. In the survey experiment, we demonstrate 
        respondents change their position on political issues based upon what 
        they are told about the positions of similar others. We find no evidence 
        that these effects are attributable to alternative mechanisms, such as 
        need for information, confirming the effects are likely caused by the 
        desire to adopt the appropriate political social norm.

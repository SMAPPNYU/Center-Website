		<br><br>
		Friday, April 10, 2015 from 2:00-3:30 PM<br>
		Meyer Building (Department of Psychology)<br>
		6 Washington Place, Room 551<br>
		<br>
		Abstract:
		<br> Psychological models of judgment and decision-making demarcate processes that contribute to error. Theories and evidence create the expectation that judgments include error. However, models have been developed mainly by studying laypeople, and as a result reference decision-making among laypeople. In contrast to the expectations for error inherent in layperson decision-making, the expectations for expert decision-makers, particularly of scientists, are that error is minimized and perhaps non-existent. In the criminal justice system experts are highly valued and regarded to provide impartial and objective evidence. In this talk, I will review real casework documenting psychological contaminations that affect experts in the criminal justice system, including fingerprinting and DNA forensic examiners. I will review theories and provide evidence articulating the psychological mechanisms by which forensic and other experts make biased and erroneous decisions. Research can help identify such weaknesses and provide practical ways to mitigate them.

		On October 24, 2014, the <a href="http://cfspb.nyu.edu/)"> The Center for Social and Political 		Behavior </a> hosted a talk by Christopher Parker, the Stuart A. Scheingold Professor of Social 		Justice and Political Science in the Department of Political Science at the University of 		Washington, on "Change They Can't Believe: The Tea Party and Reactionary Conservatism in 		America."
 	  	<br><br>
		Professor Parker spoke about his book (co-authored with Professor Matthew Barreto) entitled 		<a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9954.html)"> Change They Can't Believe: The Tea 		Party and Reactionary Conservatism in America. </a>
 	   	<br><br>
		Abstract: 
		<br>
		Are Tea Party supporters merely a group of conservative citizens concerned about government spending? Or, are they racists who refuse to accept Barack Obama as their president because of his race? Change They Can’t Believe In offers an alternative argument—the Tea Party is driven by the reemergence of a reactionary movement in American politics that is fueled by a fear that America has changed for the worst. Providing a range of original evidence and rich portraits of party sympathizers as well as activists, Parker and Barreto show that what actually pushes Tea Party supporters is not simple ideology or racism, but fear that the country is being stolen from “real Americans”—a belief triggered by Barack Obama’s election. From civil liberties and policy issues, to participation in the political process, the perception that America is in danger directly informs how Tea Party supporters think and act. The authors argue that this isn’t the first time that a segment of American society has perceived the American way of life as under siege. In fact, movements of this kind often appear when individuals believe that American values are under threat by rapid social changes. Drawing connections between the Tea Party and right-wing reactionary movements of the past—including the Know Nothing Party, the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s, and the John Birch Society—Parker and Barreto develop a framework that transcends the Tea Party to shed light on its current and future consequences. Linking past and present reactionary movements, Change They Can’t Believe In rigorously examines the motivations and political implications associated with today’s Tea Party.

        The NYU Center for Social and Political Behavior hosted a colloquium talk 
		by Dr. Evan Heit (Program Officer, NSF) on the topic of "Polarization, Political Knowledge, 		and Political Categorization." 
		<br><br>
		Abstract: 
		<br>
		In this talk I gave an overview of three projects addressing political categorization and 		reasoning.  The first project (Heit & Nicholson, 2010) examines the structure of contrasting 		categories, Democrat and Republican.  Participants (US college students) rated the typicality of 		public figures in one category or the other.  The relation between the two sets of ratings was 		negative, linear, and extremely strong, r = .9957, suggestive of extreme polarization.  The 		second project uses international data sets to determine whether this extreme polarization 		appears in other countries, and more generally investigates representation of political 		categories in countries with multi-party systems.  The third project uses a representative 		sample of US adults, who completed two political categorization tasks, identifying party 		membership of hypothetical candidates and deciding whether to vote for each person.  		Participants were successful in the identification task and likewise at voting in terms of 		their own party interests.  Success at these two tasks was positively correlated with a measure 		of political knowledge.  The pattern of responses was also influenced by the political party of 		the respondent: Feature weights depended on party membership.  All of the results were 		discussed in terms of implications for political reasoning and conceptual representation.

        The NYU Center for Social and Political Behavior hosted a colloquium talk 
		by Professor <a href="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~redlawsk"> David Redlawsk </a> of 
		Rutgers University on Friday, May 10, 2013.
        <br><br>
        David Redlawsk is Editor of <a	
		href="http://us.macmillan.com/feelingpolitics/DavidRedlawsk"> 
		"Feeling Politics: Emotion in Political Information Processing"</a>
        and Co-author of <a 
		href="http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511222993&ss=cop"> 
		"How Voters Decide: Information Processing in Election Campaigns"</a>. Professor 
		Redlawsk's talk (with Doug Pierce) was entitled "Studying Information Processing with 
		Dynamic Process Tracing: A First Look at Social Cues." 
        <br><br>
        Abstract:
        <br>
    	Understanding how voters form preferences for candidates requires
        knowledge of information search strategies, which may be conditioned on
        factors such as the competitiveness of the election, the complexity of
        the information environment, individual dispositional factors, and
        emotional responses to candidates and issues. Existing research along
        these lines tends to focus on the individual and fails to treat information
        search as at least in part a social activity. In this talk I will
        introduce an experimental tool called the Dynamic Process Tracing
        Environment (DPTE) which has been successfully used to observe
        information search processes in complex information environments. In
        particular I will focus on a new extension to DPTE which allows the
        researcher to create a "social" environment, where information
        may be tagged with social cues either in a controlled experimental
        environment or by subjects themselves, or some combination. New data on
        effects of social cues on information search in a campaign environment
        will be presented and discussed, as we begin our initial studies using
        social experiments in DPTE.

        The NYU Center for Social and Political Behavior has held its Inaugural Event on Friday, 
		April 26, 2013.

        Dr. Betsy Sinclair (University of Chicago), author of 
        <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/The-Social-Citizen-Networks-Political/dp/0226922820">
		"The Social Citizen: Peer Networks and Political Behavior." </a>
        Her talk was entitled "Voters Like You: Social Group Cues in Behavior and Opinion."
        <br><br>
        Abstract:
        <br>
        We find that social group membership, operationalized as a psychological 
        affinity toward others who are "like you", causes individuals to mirror 
        the political behaviors and choices of similar others. We conduct two 
        experiments where we demonstrate the power of these impersonal social 
        group influences through social group cues. In these experiments, 
        providing the subjects with social group cues successfully alters both 
        behavior and opinion. In the field experiment, we demonstrate voters 
        change their behavior in accord with a message telling them about levels 
        of turnout among similar others. In the survey experiment, we demonstrate 
        respondents change their position on political issues based upon what 
        they are told about the positions of similar others. We find no evidence 
        that these effects are attributable to alternative mechanisms, such as 
        need for information, confirming the effects are likely caused by the 
        desire to adopt the appropriate political social norm.

                    <small>
                     I'm an NYU faculty member in the Department of Politics, the Center for Experimental Social Science, and (with affiliated status) the Department of Psychology.  I am also a member of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology (SESP), the Experiments in Governance and Politics (EGAP) research network, and various other professional associations in political science, psychology, and experimental economics.
					<br><br>
					My experimental research uses methods from all of these disciplines.  Substantively, my recent experimental work has focused on the institutional foundations of legitimate authority and the effects of social identities on political cognition and political communication.  
					<br><br>
					I also develop behavioral game-theoretic models of political phenomena, which explicitly incorporate insights from psychology into strategic settings.  My recent work using these methods has particularly focused on the construction and contestation of identities through political processes, and the strategic advantages that can be conferred by identity attachments and irrational beliefs in behavioral equilibrium.
					<br><br>
					In addition to the time I spend at NYU, I have recently been a visiting researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse.
